# Hello World!
I'm working on compiling a list of design resources starting with UI/UX for beginners, all in a single website. I know this has been done before, but I wanted to practice building my own site for resources that I recommend. I hope you can find it helpful and enjoy!
### <a href="https://lindaicing.github.io/resources/" title="Hello World :)">See the project here</a>!
