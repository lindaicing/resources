            <h2>User Testing &amp; Psychology Terms</h2>
            <p><a href="https://medium.theuxblog.com/1bit-of-research-7-testing-in-the-wild-gorilla-style-faf72b954b31" target="_blank">Bias</a> - Preference, prejudice, or tendency that can affect a subject‚Äôs behavior during testing. These should be avoided as much as possible so your results don‚Äôt get skewed</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Confirmation Bias</em> - Tendency for people to interpret, favor, and recall info in a way that supports their beliefs. Ex. seeing favored political candidates in a good light despite any bad actions</li>
                <li><em>Hawthorne Effect</em> - Users behave differently when they know they‚Äôre being watched. Ex. Chef fumbles making food when they know Gordon Ramsay is watching them</li>
                <li><em>Social Desirability Bias</em> - Subjects might behave in ways they think the tester wants them to respond. Ex. Getting a salad when going out with friends when all you really want to eat is a large cheese pizza</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Confounding variable</em> - Suggest there is correlation when there actually isn‚Äôt</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ex. Shark bite rates seem to go up when ice cream sales go up. This isn‚Äôt because one variable ‚Äúcauses‚Äù the other, but rather both are correlated to each other since both rates go up during the summer</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Convenience/ Opportunity Sampling</em> - Using the people near you or whomever is easily available as subjects. This is sometimes a bad sampling practice since you might not be sampling from your target demographic. You might also find user bias and confounding variables</p>
            <p><em>Generalisability</em> - Extent to which findings can be applied to the complete target population</p>
            <p><em>Heuristic Evaluation</em> - Holistic test to see if the thing you‚Äôre testing is a design pattern or follows recognized usability principles</p>
            <p><a href="https://openfieldx.com/ux-research-methods-user-observation/" target="_blank">Observation</a> - Controlled observation of users means to examine how users interact with what you‚Äôre testing without interfering with how they interact with your prototype</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bPg6op9Sk46lFVGaET-fruE0qz-ctNQsxbZKF-5lpn4/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">Rainbow Spreadsheet</a> is super helpful to track what you‚Äôre doing while observing users</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Random Sampling</em> - When everyone in a target demographic has an equal chance of being selected. No testing is truly random, but ideally we can get close</p>
            <p><em>Sample</em> - Participants that you select from a target population</p>
            <p><em>Stratified Sampling</em> - When subgroups (such as gender identity or age) are identified and participants are selected in proportion to those subgroups</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ex. 50 eggplant lovers and 20 peach lovers are in your selection pool.</li>
                <li>10% of each subgroup is selected to be tested, giving you 5 eggplant lovers and 2 peach lovers, all randomly selected subjects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Subject</em> - An individual you‚Äôre conducting a (user) test on</p>
            <p><em>Systematic Sampling</em> - sampling users using a system</p>
            <p><em>Target Population</em> - Total group from which subjects can be found from</p>
            <p><em>Think Aloud</em> - Ask participants to test your product while saying what they‚Äôre thinking/ vocalizing their action for a better grasp of their thought process</p>
            <p><em>Volunteer Sample</em> - Participants opt into your study</p>
